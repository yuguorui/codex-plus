# Workflow Authoring

Read [references/api.md](references/api.md) before writing or modifying a workflow script.

Start by identifying a bounded work list in the owning agent. Use `pipeline()` when each item can
advance independently through several stages, and `parallel()` when the next step needs all prior
results. Keep deterministic grouping, filtering, ranking, and deduplication in JavaScript.

Every `agent()` prompt is one non-empty string. Assemble prompt fragments with a template literal
for task instructions. Pass variable data through named `inputs`, especially complete
upstream agent results. Use one synthesis agent with the complete input set, and return the final
JSON-compatible value from the script.
Use `agentSettled()` when script logic needs an explicit status and failure kind for branching;
use `agent()` for its `null` and exception behavior.

Use default fail-soft `parallel()` for independent exploration where missing slots are acceptable.
Use `parallel(thunks, { requireAll: true })` for critical synthesis fan-in, or explicitly verify the
result count before continuing, so final synthesis receives every required upstream result.

For a new script, pass it inline to Workflow. For an iteration, edit the persisted `scriptPath` and
resume the stopped or failed run with `resumeFromRunId` when replay is useful. Provide exactly one
of `script`, `name`, or `scriptPath` in each invocation; remote calls use inline `script`.
When orchestration logic itself needs workspace text, declare it with bounded `meta.inputs` globs
and read the frozen contents through `await listInputs()` and `await readInput(path)`. Workflows
without declared workspace inputs do not scan the workspace. Keep process execution, live
filesystem access, and file writes in agents using their ordinary tools. Do not confuse declared
workspace inputs with structured `agent(..., { inputs })` values passed to one subagent.
When the owning turn needs the final result before it can continue, call `WaitWorkflow` with the
launch result's `runId`. Use `WaitWorkflows` for bounded `any` or `all` waits across several runs.
Both waits are repeatable and preserve steered input when they return `interruptedByUserInput: true`.
Use `ListWorkflowAgents` to find a completed Workflow agent's `agentId`, then call `wait_agent`
when its intermediate detail is useful. Use `ReadWorkflowResult` for the terminal Workflow result;
choose `maxBytes` when useful and continue from `nextOffset` only while the result is incomplete.

Use `agent(prompt, { inputs: { reports } })` for synthesis. The downstream agent receives
`AnalyzeWorkflowInputs`, which runs synchronous pure JavaScript against deep-frozen
`globalThis.inputs` in a fresh V8 isolate. Tell the agent to inspect every required input and use
multiple calls when needed, returning focused views for reasoning while the complete inputs remain
available.
